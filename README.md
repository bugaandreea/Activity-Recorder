Activity-Recorder
=================

Android Project for detecting the activity of the mobile phone user from one of the three classes: walking, standing, sitting. Uses Weka library for Android and machine learning principles.
The visualization and classification part is not currently working as the server component was stopped. The server part and the client connectivity part (the actclient package) was developed by the university.
